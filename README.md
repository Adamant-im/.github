# .github: ADAMANT's Organization-wide GitHub settings

[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/💖_Donate-adamant.im/donate-green)](https://adamant.im/donate/)

This repository contains **community health files** for the whole [Adamant-im](https://github.com/Adamant-im) organization.  
GitHub uses this special repository to share issue templates, PR templates, and other defaults across all repositories in the org.

## Funding

Located in `.github/FUNDING.yml`:

This file defines additional ways to financially support the ADAMANT community and its projects. It serves as a source of funding links across all repositories in the organization.

## Labels Configuration

This repository contains the `labels.json` file, which serves as the **single source of truth for GitHub issue labels** across all repositories in the `Adamant-im` organization.

### Purpose

- Standardize labels across multiple repositories
- Ensure consistency in naming, colors, and descriptions
- Enable automated synchronization via GitHub Actions

### File Format

`labels.json` is an array of objects, each representing a label:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "bug",
    "color": "d73a4a",
    "description": "Something isn't working"
  },
  {
    "name": "enhancement",
    "color": "a2eeef",
    "description": "New feature or request"
  }
]
```

Fields:

- `name` (string) – The label name (required)
- `color` (string) – A 6-character hex color code (required)
- `description` (string) – A short description of the label (optional)

> Note: If exported directly from GitHub API, extra fields may exist. Only `name`, `color`, and `description` are used for synchronization.

### How to Update

1. Edit or add new labels in `labels.json`
2. Commit and push your changes to this repository
3. GitHub Actions workflow will automatically synchronize labels across all linked repositories

### Manual Synchronization

If needed, you can manually sync labels using [`github-label-sync`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/github-label-sync):

```bash
npx github-label-sync --labels labels.json --access-token <YOUR_TOKEN> owner/repo
```

(Replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with a GitHub personal access token with **read/write access** to the target repository.)

### Notes

- Keep `labels.json` up-to-date to maintain consistency across repositories
- Only labels defined here will be synchronized; any manual changes in individual repos may be overwritten

## Issue Templates

Located in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

- **`bug_report.yml`** – Template for reporting bugs, includes steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and environment details
- **`feature_request.yml`** – Template for suggesting new features or enhancements
- **`task_general.yml`** – Generic task template for issues that don’t fit into other categories
- **`task_apprelease.yml`** – Template for tracking app release preparation tasks
- **`task_publication.yml`** – Template for tasks related to publishing (e.g., releases, announcements)
- **`config.yml`** – GitHub configuration file that controls the issue template chooser (defines which templates appear when creating a new issue)

These templates ensure that contributors provide the necessary information when creating issues, which helps maintain clarity and consistency across all repositories.

All `.yml` files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` are [Issue Forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) and appear in `https://github.com/Adamant-im/<repo>/issues/new/choose` for every repository in this organization (unless that repository defines its own templates).

> Note: Templates in individual repositories **override** these org-wide defaults.

## Pull Request Template

- **`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** – A default template shown when opening pull requests.  
  It guides contributors to describe the purpose of the PR, summarize changes, and link related issues.
